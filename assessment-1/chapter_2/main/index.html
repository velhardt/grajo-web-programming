                <p>
                    The Will of The Many is the first book in the Hierarchy series, which takes
                    place in a fantasy world inspired by the Roman Republic. Our protagonist is
                    Vis Telimus, the last surviving prince of a kingdom conquered by the Catenan
                    republic who lives as an orphan to hide from the regime. When he is suddenly
                    adopted by a senator to be used as a pawn, Vis finds himself entangled in
                    several competing conspiracies, and must navigate a prestigious school for
                    senators’ children to survive.

                                Will is the summation of all of a person's drive, focus, physical and mental energy. Will is the source of power of the Hierarchy and is how it established dominion over the known world.
                                Will can be ceded from one person to another. There are multiple ways to enable people to cede to one another. The most common way for people in the Catenan Republic is to visit the Aurora Columnae. Within the Catenan Republic, it is commonplace to cede half of their will to anyone at any time

                                The Catenan Republic envelops the entire continent on which it is situated. It is located in the southern hemisphere of its world, due to which the nothern regions generally have a milder and mediterranean climate, while the southern regions have a colder continental to arctic climate.
                                The Catenan Republic employs a strict social rank system, known as the Hierarchy. Since almost all citizens of the Republic participate in will ceding, the name "Hierarchy" is often used interchangeably with the Catenan Republic. People take their ranks very seriously and are very respectful and polite to the ranks above them, even when they aren't part of the same pyramid.

                    "An orphaned prince on the run gets a chance at freedom if he can become one of his would-be enslavers.
                    Three years ago, when the Hierarchy killed his family, 17-year-old Vis Solum had to hide in their Republic, bury his rage, and pretend to support the population’s enslavement in order to survive. The Hierarchy is built on Will—a person’s mental and physical energy—ceded by the low to those above them, and then again, all the way to the top of the three pyramids of leadership: Military, Governance, and Religion. Will powers carts and carriages, keeps vaults locked, and gives Will-users inhuman abilities while sapping ceders of their health and life span. So far, Vis has managed to refuse the ritual to cede his Will. Now, he has little more than a year before he legally has to cede or have his Will drained by Sappers. When Senator Quintus Ulciscor Telimus offers Vis the chance to escape ceding for at least another year, and perhaps never do it at all, Vis agrees. The man officially adopts him so he can attend the Catenan Academy, where all students are tested and prepared for the highest Hierarchy positions. If Vis dominates at the Academy, he can choose a position where he doesn’t need to cede or receive Will at all, far away from the Hierarchy. In return, Vis must act as a spy to prove Religion is unearthing a dangerous weapon. Then, when Vis is blackmailed to act as a double agent, everything changes. In order to succeed, he must become one of those he so hates while keeping his true identity a secret. If he doesn’t, he’ll end up dead, or worse. This Roman-inspired fantasy starts slow but more than makes up for it soon enough. With the inevitable comparisons in mind, fans of Pierce Brown's Red Rising will enjoy this book, but it’s darker, deeper, and takes unexpected paths worth traveling. Trust that the author will get you there in the end."

                    "This book deserves much more hype!

                    Dark Academia + Roman Culture + Unique & Controversial Magic System

                    Starts slow and yes, the book is long but it's totally worth it.

                    This is a story full of: intrigue, agony, deviousness, power disputes.
                    It has a certain complexity to understand not only the magic system but the structure that makes up this society. There is a lot of cruelty, injustice, greed... Basically Machiavellianism in all its unpleasant splendor.

                    "There are those who see what should be, and complain that they do not get their due. And then there are those who see what is, and figure out how to use it to their advantage. Or at least, overcome it."

                    Full of plot twists, great world building, lots of political schemes. The characters are tricky and interesting. It is not a light read nor for delicate hearts.

                    "Death is only meaningless if it does not change us."

                    I'm really looking forward to the publication date of the next book in this series that promises to be one of my favorites."

                    "An incredible, unpredictable, and wonderfully twisty fast-paced read that I could not put down. Tense and exciting, this book reminded me of Pierce Brown's Red Rising with its Roman Empire inspired worldbuilding and undercover protagonist surrounded by people he cannot trust, but it has its own style and vibe that separate it from Brown's also phenomenal series. If you're looking for a book to break your reading slump or keep you up until 3am reading, this is the book for you. Great characters, a thrilling plot, and so much fun. Plus, that ending was a serious wtf that made me excited for whatever strange twist comes next. I'm looking forward to book 2.

                    I received a free ARC which in no way impacted my honest review."
