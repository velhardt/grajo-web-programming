                    The Will of The Many is the first book in the Hierarchy series, which takes
                    place in a fantasy world inspired by the Roman Republic. Our protagonist is
                    Vis Telimus, the last surviving prince of a kingdom conquered by the Catenan
                    republic who lives as an orphan to hide from the regime. When he is suddenly
                    adopted by a senator to be used as a pawn, Vis finds himself entangled in
                    several competing conspiracies, and must navigate a prestigious school for
                    senatorsâ€™ children to survive.
