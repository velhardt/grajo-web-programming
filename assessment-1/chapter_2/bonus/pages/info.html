                                    Will is the summation of all of a person's drive, focus, physical and mental energy. Will is the source of power of the Hierarchy and is how it established dominion over the known world.
                                    Will can be ceded from one person to another. There are multiple ways to enable people to cede to one another. The most common way for people in the Catenan Republic is to visit the Aurora Columnae. Within the Catenan Republic, it is commonplace to cede half of their will to anyone at any time

                                <dl>
                                    The Catenan Republic envelops the entire continent on which it is situated. It is located in the southern hemisphere of its world, due to which the nothern regions generally have a milder and mediterranean climate, while the southern regions have a colder continental to arctic climate.
                                    The Catenan Republic employs a strict social rank system, known as the Hierarchy. Since almost all citizens of the Republic participate in will ceding, the name "Hierarchy" is often used interchangeably with the Catenan Republic. People take their ranks very seriously and are very respectful and polite to the ranks above them, even when they aren't part of the same pyramid.

                                    Solivagus is the island on which the Catenan Academy is located.
                                    The Southern tip of the island, where Catenan Academy is located, is formed a large elevated plateau with sharp white cliffs that drop off into the sea.
